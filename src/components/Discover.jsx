//discover component did mount, do runs the getShows api from services/ ArtsyAPI
//Artsy API gets a new token and request the data from the shows, THEN it does console.log the information from the aAPI and sends it back with a return
//Back in component did mount, the information retrieved from artsy does not get here, seems to be an asynchrnus issue, plis send jeeeelp
